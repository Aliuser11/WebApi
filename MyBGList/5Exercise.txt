5.6.1Create
Modify the SeedController's Put() method so that it will accept an optional
Id parameter of integer type. If such a parameter is present, the method will
only add the board game having that given Id, thus skipping all the others;
otherwise, it will act just like it already does.


5.6.2 Read
Change the BoardGamesController's Get() method's filtering behavior:
instead of returning the board games having a Name that contains the
filterQuery, it should return the board games having a Name that starts with
the filterQuery.


5.6.3 Update
Improve the capabilities of the BoardGamesController's Post method so that
it can be used to also update the following columns of the [BoardGames]
table: MinPlayers, MaxPlayers, PlayTime, MinAge. It's worth noting that, to
properly implement such a change, the BoardGameDTO type will also need to
be updated accordingly.


5.6.4 Delete
Modify the BoardGamesController's Delete() method replacing the current
id integer parameter with a new idList string parameter, which will be used
by clients to specify a comma-separated list of Id keys instead of a single Id.
The improved method should perform the following tasks:

=> Ensure that each single id contained in the idList parameter is of an integer type.
=> Delete all the board games matching one of the given id keys.
=> Return a RestDTO<BoardGame[]?> JSON object containing all the deleted board games in the data array.
