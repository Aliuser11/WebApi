[ResponseCache] attribute is part of the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc namespace

The [ResponseCache] attribute can be configured using the following properties:
- Duration. Determines the max-age value of the Cache-control header,
which controls the duration (in seconds) for which the response is
cached.

- Location. Determines who can cache the response: Any if both clients
and proxies are allowed to, Private to allow clients only, or None to
disable it. These values will respectively set the public, private or nocache
directive in the Cache-control header.

- NoStore. When set to true, sets the Cache-control header value to nostore,
thus disabling the cache. This is typically used for error pages,
since they typically contain "unique" info for the specific request that
raised the error which would have no sense to cache.

example 
we're dealing with error response messages, we can use this opportunity to use the
NoStore property to prevent anyone from caching them in the following way:

app.MapGet("/error",
[EnableCors("AnyOrigin")]
[ResponseCache(NoStore = true)] () =>
Results.Problem());
app.MapGet("/error/test",
[EnableCors("AnyOrigin")]
[ResponseCache(NoStore = true)] () =>
{ throw new Exception("test"); });

BoardGamesController, => et up a public cache with a max-age of 60 seconds for that response

// ...
[HttpGet(Name = "GetBoardGames")]
[ResponseCache(Location = ResponseCacheLocation.Any, Duration = 60)]
public IEnumerable<BoardGame> Get()
// ...
