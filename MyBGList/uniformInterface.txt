Uniform interface - guiding principles
- Identification of resources. Each individual resource must be univocally
identified, for example using URIs, and represented using a standard
format (such as JSON).

- Manipulation through representations. The representation sent to the
client should contain enough info to modify or delete the resource, as
well as adding further resources of the same kind (if the client has the
permissions to do that).

- Self-descriptive messages. The representation sent to the client should
contain all the required info to process the received data. This can be
done by adding relevant info using JSON (which HTTP method to use,
which MIME type to expect, and so on), as well as using HTTP headers
and metadata (for caching info, character set, and the likes).

- Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS). Clients
should be able to interact with the application without any specific
knowledge beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia: in other
words, the manipulation through representation should only be handled
(and documented) using standard, descriptive links.
