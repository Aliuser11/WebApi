specifics that we need to ensure:
1. Testers can only use 55221 and 55222 TCP ports
2. Testers will only use the Kestrel web server
3. The web browser used to test the app should start with the JSON list of
the BoardGames that is returned by the BoardGamesController‘s Get()
action method
4. Testers, just like Developers, must be allowed to access to the
SwaggerUI page, but not to the Developer Exception Page, which
should be unavailable for them
5. Testers need to retrieve the following additional fields for each
boardgame: MinPlayers and MaxPlayers, that should contain the
number of minimum and maximum players supported by the board
game.
